        The <span class="vat">Vat</span> system's goal is to support interactive data exploration by tracking the data processing
        automatically in the background. You can view the complete processing workflow for individual layers by selecting <i>Lineage</i> in
        the layer context menu and the lineage for all layers by clicking on the context menu of the layer list in the top left.
