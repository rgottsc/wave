    <p>
        The <span class="vat">Vat</span> system supports two very different types of data: raster and vector data. Rasters consist of many
        pixels, and each pixel contains a value for the particular location, e.g. the mean temperature. Vector data are collections of
        features with attributes, e.g. a set of occurrences of pumas and the time of the observation
    </p>
    <p>
        Under <i>Add Data</i> you can select one of several environmental layers (rasters), occurrence data from
        <a href="http://www.gbif.org" target="_blank">GBIF</a>, data from GFBio archives in ABCD format and your own custom data
    </p>
    <p>Each data set is added to the map as a layer which you can further process with <i>operators</i>.</p>
